                <h3>Rules and objectives</h3>
                <p>Rules for competitions draw closely on original medieval texts outlining sport (i.e. non-lethal) tournament combat, such as King Ren√©'s Tournament Book from 1460. Where original information is not available, or would present too great a risk to those fighting, new rules can be devised by an international team of referees, or marshals, to be voted upon by fighters. As a young sport, rules are regularly updated in response to observations during competitions and subsequently rules of fighting may vary somewhat year-by-year.</p>

                <h3>Armour</h3>
                <p>All fighters must wear historical steel armour that encloses the torso, limbs, head & neck, & hands, and beneath this a padded layer, known as a gambeson. Helmets must be analogous to the rest of the armour, must cover the face and must be closed with a strap to prevent removal during combat. All armour must be of a style traceable to a historical period and location, no piece may date from more than 50 years of another. Fighters may wear a supplementary third layer of protective equipment beneath their gambeson, provided it is not visible and does not replace any armour above it, such as a Protective Cup or mouthguard.</p>

                <h3>Weapons</h3>
                <p>All weapons are reproductions based on historical originals. These originals may be found in museums or drawings traceable to the period. All weapons must be blunt and within a set weight and size category, dependent upon the weapon. Metal maces, axes, swords (including falchions) and polearms are all permitted in group fights, while war hammers and weapons with hammer attachments may not be used in international events.</p>

                <h3>Shields</h3>
                <p>Shields are commonly used as weapons as much as swords and other such medieval arms, with fighters choosing to combine strikes from their primary weapon alongside punches with their shield. Subsequently, shields are regulated as weapons. While being historical in design, shields must also meet a minimum weight requirement and not have narrow, sharp or metal edges.</p>
