                <p>Wood drying (also seasoning lumber or wood seasoning) reduces the moisture content of wood before its use. When the drying is done in a kiln, the product is known as kiln-dried timber or lumber, whereas air drying is the more traditional method.</p>

                <h3>Wood Preservation</h3>
                <img src="../../Images/WoodPreservation.webp" width="800" height="556" alt="Wood preservation"/>
                <p>All measures that are taken to ensure a long life of wood fall under the definition wood preservation. Apart from structural wood preservation measures, there are a number of different (chemical) preservatives and processes (also known as timber treatment, lumber treatment or pressure treatment) that can extend the life of wood, timber, wood structures or engineered wood. These generally increase the durability and resistance from being destroyed by insects or fungus.</p>

                <h3>Heat Treatment</h3>
                <img src="../../Images/HeatTreatment.webp" width="800" height="556" alt="Heat treatment"/>
                <p>By going beyond kiln drying wood, heat treatment may make timber more durable. By heating timber to a certain temperature, it may be possible to make the wood fibre less appetizing to insects.
                    Heat treatment can also improve the properties of the wood with respect to water, with lower equilibrium moisture, less moisture deformation, and weather resistance. It is weather-resistant enough to be used unprotected, in facades or in kitchen tables, where wetting is expected. However, heating can reduce the amount of volatile organic compounds, which generally have antimicrobial properties</p>
